### 🧠 Computer AI Strategy (Single-Player)
The computer uses intelligent AI with this priority:
1. **🏆 Win if possible** - Takes winning moves when available
2. **🛡️ Block opponent** - Prevents you from winning on your next turn
3. **🎯 Take center** - Prioritizes the center square for strategic advantage
4. **🔲 Take corners** - Chooses corner positions when available
5. **📝 Fill remaining** - Takes any available space as a last resort

### 🏆 Winning Patterns
Look for these winning combinations:
```
X | X | X    X |   |      X |   |      X |   |   
---------    ---------    ---------    ---------
  |   |      X |   |        | X |        |   | X
  |   |      X |   |        |   | X      |   | X
```

### 🎲 Game Examples

#### Example 1: Quick Win
1. You place X in center
2. Computer places O in corner
3. You place X in opposite corner
4. Computer blocks with O
5. You place X in remaining corner - **You win!**

#### Example 2: Strategic Play
1. You place X in corner
2. Computer takes center
3. You place X in opposite corner
4. Computer blocks with O
5. You place X in remaining corner - **You win!**

### 🔧 Troubleshooting Game Issues

#### Single-Player Issues
- **Game not responding**: Try clicking the "New Game" button
- **Can't make moves**: Ensure you're clicking empty squares
- **Computer not moving**: Wait a moment, the AI needs time to think

#### Multiplayer Issues
- **Can't connect**: Make sure the server is running first
- **Connection lost**: Restart both client and server
- **Game stuck**: Close all windows and restart the session
- **Port issues**: Ensure port 8000 is not used by other applications

### 🎯 Pro Tips
- **Study the computer's moves** to learn better strategies
- **Practice in single-player** before trying multiplayer
- **Use the center position** - it's the most valuable square
- **Look ahead** - think about your opponent's next move
- **Don't rush** - take time to plan your strategy
